- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Picoodi 
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in Raspberry Pi`s (especially the Pico W), a bit in Networks, and of course Python to code myself helpfull tools for my science studys 
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning more about Python and MicroPython, but also with the Pico W about IoT
- âš¡ Fun fact:I still have a lot of contact to the outside world and touch grass.
